Our methodology is specifically designed for analyzing multimodal data encompassing neuroimaging and genetic information. We utilize neuroimaging data obtained from T1-weighted MRI in the form of cortical thickness and functional MRI scans measuring the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, to provide a comprehensive understanding of both structural and functional aspects of the brain. Additionally, we employ DTI tractography to facilitate the simultaneous identification of structurally linked features across two MRI modalities
